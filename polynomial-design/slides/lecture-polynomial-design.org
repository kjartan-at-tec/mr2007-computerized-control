** Procedure
   Given plant model \(H(z)=\frac{B(z)}{A(z)}\) and specifications on the desired closed-loop poles \(A_{cl}(z)\)
   1. Find polynomials \(R(z)\) and \(S(z)\) with \(n_R \ge n_S\) such that 
      \[ A(z)R(z)z^{d} + B(z)S(z) = A_{cl}(z) \]
   2. Factor the closed-loop polynomials as \(A_{cl}(z) = A_c(z)A_o(z)\), where \(n_{A_o} \le n_R\). Choose
      \[T(z) = t_0 A_o(z),\] where \(t_0 = \frac{A_c(1)}{B(1)}\).

   The control law is then
   \[ R(q) u(k) = T(q)u_c(k) - S(q)y(k). \]
   The closed-loop response to the command signal is given by
   \[ A_c(q)y(k) = t_0 B(q) u_c(k). \]
** Determining the order of the controller
   With Diophantine equation 
      \[ A(z)R(z)z^{d} + B(z)S(z) = A_{cl}(z) \qquad (*) \]
   and feedback controller
   \[F_b(z) = \frac{S(z)}{R(z)} = \frac{s_0z^n + s_1z^{n-1} + \cdots + s_n}{z^n + r_1 z^{n-1} + \cdots + r_n}\]
   *How should we choose the order of the controller?* Note:
   - the controller has $n+n+1 = 2\deg R + 1$ unknown parameters
   - the LHS of \((*)\) has degree $\deg \big(A(z)R(z)z^d + B(z)S(z)\big) = \deg A + \deg R + d$
   - The diophantine gives as many (nontrivial) equations as the degree of the polynomials on each side when we set the coefficients equal.

     *\(\Rightarrow\;\)Choose \(\deg R\) so that \(2\deg R + 1 = \deg A + \deg R + d\)*
     

** Determining the order of the controller - Exercise 1
   With the plant model \[H(z) = \frac{B(z)}{A(z)} = \frac{b}{z + a}\] and \(d=0\) (no delay), what is the appropriate degree of the controller 
\[F_b(z) = \frac{S(z)}{R(z)} = \frac{s_0z^n + s_1z^{n-1} + \cdots + s_n}{z^n + r_1 z^{n-1} + \cdots + r_n}\]
   so that all parameters can be determined from the diophantine equation
   \[ A(z)R(z) + B(z)S(z) = A_c(z)A_o(z)?\]

Plant dynamics: \( x(t) = x(t-1) -v(t) + u(t) \)

*** Notes							   :noexport:
    - x is change in level of water in the dam from some operating point Volume = Volume_0 + x
    - u is change in flow through dam gates from some operating point. 
    - v is change in flow out. Either through increase in flow through power dam or decrease in river  
      d/dt Vol =  d/dt (Vol_0 + x(t)) = flow in - flow out
               = n_0 - v_0 - v(t) - u_0 + u(t), with n_0 - v_0 - u_0 = 0   
      dx/dt = u - v. 

    - Model  X = \frac{z}{z-1} (U-V) 

    - H(z) = B(z)/A(z) = z/(z-1). 

    - Diophantine eqn
      AR + BS = Ac
      (z-1)R + zS = Ac
      With first-order controller S/R = (s0z + s1)/(z + r1)
      (z-1)(z+r1) + z(s0z + s1) = (z-0.7)^2 , Ac = Acl = (z-0.7)^2 
      or Ac = Acl Ao = (z-0.7)(z-a) 

      (z-1)(z+r1) + s0z^2 + s1z = (z-0.7)(z-a)
      z^2 - (1-r1)z -r1  + s0z^2 + s1z = z^2 - (0.7+a)z + 0.7*a.
      z^2: 1 + s0 = 1   => s0=0
      z^1: -(1-r1) + s1 = -(0.7+a)
      z^0: -r1 = 0.7a

      
      r1s0s1 = [0, 1, 0; 1, 0, 1; -1, 0, 0]\[1; -0.7-a; 0.7*a] 


      (-2+s0) = -0.7-a => s0 = 1.3-a
      s1 = 0.7*a - 1

      We have Gc = T/R B/A / (1 + S/R B/A) = TB / (AR + BS) = TB / (Ao Ac)
      Let T = Ao*t_0
      Gc = t_0 B / Ac, Want Gc(1) = 1 
      t_0 = Ac(1) / B(1) = (1-0.7)/1 = 0.3.
