SR	In your own words, what is the purpose of the incremental RST controller? How does it differ from the regular RST controller?	The incremental RST controller contains an integrator. Sometimes the specifications on the closed-loop system is that the steady-state error should be eliminated, and this may lead to the requirement that the controller contains integral action. With the non-incremental RST controller, we cannot force the R-polynomial to have a factor (z-1), i.e. a root in 1. 
SR	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>The RST design technique suggests that the feed-forward part of the controller should be \[F_f(z) = \frac{t_0 A_o(z)}{R(z)}\] where \(A_o(z)\) is the observer polynomial and \(R(z)\) is the denominator of the feedback part of the controller. The degree of \(A_o(z)\) must be equal or less than the degree of  \(R(z)\). Why is this necessary?	If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, the discrete-time system is non-causal. The implemented controller has no way of knowing future values of its input signals.  
SR	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>Assume that we require our RST controller to have two integrations, so that the Diophantine equation becomes \[A(z)(z-1)^2R(z) + B(z)S(z) = A_c(z). \] Why should we choose the order of \(S(z)\) to be\[n_S = n_R + 2\]? 	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>Since we want the controller \[\frac{S(z)}{(z-1)^2R(z)}\] to have the same order in the numerator as in the denominator.

What is the simplest controller (lowest order of the S-polynomial) we can determine from the diophantine equation?	2	incorrect	3	correct	4	incorrect	1	incorrect 
SR	Explain briefly how you arrived at the answer to the previous question. 	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>The controller will have \((n_R+2) +1 + n_R = 2n_R + 3\) unknown parameters. The S-polynomial has one more parameters than its degree. The Diophantine eqation will give as many equations in the unknowsn as the degree of the polynomials. The degree must be \(n_R+2+n_A = n_R+2+2 = n_R+4\). In order for the number of equations to equal the number unknowns we get \(2n_R + 3 = n_R+4 \quad \Rightarrow\quad n_R = 1\). And so the degree of the S-polynomial is 3.
