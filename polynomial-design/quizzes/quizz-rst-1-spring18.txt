MC	The RST-design technique is an example of control design by pole placement. Which poles are to be placed?	The open-loop poles	incorrect	The closed-loop poles	correct	The magnetic poles	incorrect
MC	Often the specifications of the desired properties of the closed-loop system are expressed as properties of its transient response, typically the step response. These must be translated into desired poles. So, for a discrete-time system, a specification on the rise time of the step response translates into 	distance to the unit circle	incorrect	distance to the point 1	correct	distance to the point -1	incorrect	distance to the origin	incorrect
MC	In discrete time poles that correspond to a step response with large and slowly decaying oscillations  are	Close to the imaginary axis	incorrect	Close to the real axis	incorrect	Close to the unit circle	correct

What must the order of \(A_c(z)\) be?	2	incorrect	3	correct	4	incorrect	1	incorrect 
SR	Explain briefly how you arrived at the solution to the previous problem.	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>The polynomials on the left- and right hand side of the Diophantine equation must have the same degree. Since the left hand side has degree \(\max (n_A+n_R, n_B+n_S) = \max(2+1, 1+1)=3\) so must the right hand side \(A_c(z)\).
SR	The Diophantine equation gives us a system of linear equations in the controller parameters. In the example above, how many such linear equations do we get from the Diophantine equation?	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>We get one equation more than the order of the polynomials on either side of the Diophantine equation. Above we have polynomials of order 3, and so we get 4 equations. However, by convention \(A(z)\), \(R(z)\) and \(A_c(z)\) all have a coefficient of 1 for the highest power of \(z\). So the equation corresponding to \(z^3\) will be trivially satisfied (\(1=1\)).
SR	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>Explain in your own words why we set \(r_0=1\) in the \(R(z)\)-polynomial, i.e. \(R(z) = z^n + r_1z^{n-1} + \cdots +  r_n\) without loss of generality. Is this not an limitation?	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>If the \(R\)-polynomial has a leading coefficients different from one, the feedback controller can be written \[F_b(z) = \frac{S(z)}{R(z)} = \frac{\beta_0z^m + \beta_1z^{m-1} + \cdots + \beta_m}{\alpha_0z^n + \alpha_1z^{n-1} + \cdots + \alpha_n} = \frac{s_0z^m + s_1z^{m-1} + \cdots + s_m}{z^n + r_1z^{n-1} + \cdots + r_n}\] by simply dividing by \(\alpha_0\) above and below the fraction line. The requirement \(r_0=1\) does not lead to loss of generality.
