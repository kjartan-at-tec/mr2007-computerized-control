SR	In your own words, what does the sampling theorem tell us, and why is it important?	The sampling theorem tells us that a continuous-time signal can be exactly reconstructed from evenly spaced samples of the signal if and only if the signal contains no frequencies above half the sampling frequency. It means that we must be careful when we choose the sampling period of our control system, so that we do not get aliasing affects from sampling a signal with high frequency content at too low a sampling rate.

Consider an aircraft propeller as in the figure below rotating at 2000RPM,  or about 33 rotations per second. <p><img src="http://alfkjartan.github.io/images/aircraft-prop.png" width="500"></p> If we are filming the propeller, how fast must the frame rate of our video camera be in order to avoid aliasing effects?	>66Hz	incorrect	>33Hz	incorrect	>264Hz	correct

It causes high frequency signals to masquerade as low frequency signals when sampled, as in the figure below.  To find the low frequency alias \(\omega\) of a high freqency sinusoid \(\omega_1\), The expression \[ \omega = \left| \big( (\omega_1 + \omega_N) \, \text{mod}\, \omega_s\big) - \omega_N\right|\] can be used (equation 7.10 in the textbook). For instance, this tells us that a sinusoid of frequency 0.9Hz will have the alias 0.1Hz when the signal is sampled at 1Hz, since \[ \omega = \left| \big( (0.9 + 0.5) \, \text{mod}\, 1\big) - 0.5\right| = |0.4 - 0.5| = 0.1.\]  See figure 7.8 in the textbook. <p><img src="http://alfkjartan.github.io/images/comp-contr-fig7.8.png" width="500"></p> Using equation (7.10), what is the alias of the frequency 2.1Hz when the sampling frequency is 2Hz?	1.1Hz	incorrect	0.7Hz	incorrect	0.6Hz	incorrect	0.5Hz	incorrect	0.3Hz	incorrect	0.1Hz	correct
MC	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>Exact reconstruction of a continuous-time signal \(f(t)\) from discrete samples \(f(kh)\) of the signal can be done exactly, provided that the Fourier transform of \(f(t)\) is zero outside the interval \( (-\omega_N, \omega_N)\), where \(\omega_N = \frac{\pi}{h}\) is the Nyquist frequency. The reconstruction is given by the formula \[f(t) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} f(kh) sinc \left( \frac{\omega_s(t-kh)}{2}\right).\]This is called Shannon reconstruction. The impulse response of the Shannon reconstruction is given in figure 7.3 in the textbook. <p><img src="http://alfkjartan.github.io/images/comp-contr-fig7.3.png" width="500"></p> In computer-controlled systems we need to convert discrete sequences of control signals into continous signals. This is done by the D-A converter. However, the exact Shannon reconstruction is never used. Why?	It is too complicated	incorrect	It is non-causal	correct	It is sensitive to round-off errors	incorrect	The closed-loop system can become unstable	incorrect    
MA	To reduce the effect of aliasing, it is often necessary to use an anti-aliasing filter before sampling the continuous-time signal. Which factors are important to take into account when designing this filter? 	The frequency content of the signal to be sampled	correct	The order of the pulse-transfer function of the controller	incorrect	The order of the pulse-transfer function of the plant model	incorrect	The sampling frequency	correct	How much delay we can accept in the feedback path	correct
MC	Astrom and Wittenmark ask the important question "When can dynamics of antialiasing filters be neglected?" What is the answer?	Always	incorrect	Almost always	incorrect	Almost never	correct	Never	incorrect
