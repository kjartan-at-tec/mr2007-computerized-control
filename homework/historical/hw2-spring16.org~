* Exercises
** Sample the continuous-time transfer function
   Consider the harmonic oscillator with transfer function 
   \begin{equation}
    G(s) = \frac{\omega^2}{s^2 + \omega^2}.
    \label{eq:contsys}
    \end{equation}


   *Compute the pulse-transfer function* by sampling the transfer function $G(s)$. 

** Simulation of the continuous- and discrete-time harmonic oscillator
Use matlab's control toolbox or the [[http://python-control.sourceforge.net/][python control module]]  to simulate the system and verify your calculations. 

***  Define systems
First, define the continuous-time system in \eqref{eq:contsys}
#+BEGIN_SRC octave
omega = 1; % Just a suggestion
h = 0.2/omega; % Completely undamped system. This gives about 30 samples per period 
sys_c = tf([omega^2],[1 0 omega^2])
#+END_SRC
Sample the system using the function =c2d=
#+BEGIN_SRC octave
sys_c2d = c2d(sys_c, h)
#+END_SRC
Define the discrete-time system you calculated in the first part of the homework
#+BEGIN_SRC octave
num = [1 a1 a2];
den = [b1 b2];
sys_d = tf(num, den, h)
#+END_SRC
*Verify that the two discrete-time systems* =sys_c2d= *and* =sys_d= *are identical.*

***  Simulate step responses
Simulate for 4 complete periods 
#+BEGIN_SRC octave
Tc = linspace(0, 4*(2*pi/omega), 800);
[yc,tc] = step(sys_c, Tc);

Td = h*(0:120);
[yd,td] = step(sys_d, Td);

figure()
clf
plot(tc,yc)
hold on
plot(td,yd, 'r*')
#+END_SRC

*Verify that the step response of the discrete-time system is exactly equal to that of the continuous-time system at the sampling instants. Explain why this is so!*

*** Compute the discrete step response yourself
    Write some lines of code that solves the difference equation
    \[ y(k+2) = -a_1y(k+1) - a_2y(k) + b_1u(k+1) + b_2u(k) \]
    for the harmonic oscillator. 
   Use the initial state \(y(-1)=y(0)=0\) and compute the response to a step sequence 
    \[ u(k) = \begin{cases} 1, & k \ge 0\\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}.\]
    Verify that your solution is the same as when using the =step= function in the previous exercise in this homework.
 

* Not now							   :noexport:
** Simulate ramp response
   Simulate a ramp response using the function \texttt{lsim} for both the continous-time and the sampled system. *Why are the responses different?* *Why is the amplitude of the response not increasing with time?*

** Calculate the eigenvalues
   Verify by hand-calculation and with help of the computer that the identity
   \[ \lambda_i = \mexp{p_ih} \]
   holds for the relationship between the poles of the continous and sampled systems.

** Step response as sampling interval increases
   Simulate step responses for values of $h$ around $\omega h = \pi$.
