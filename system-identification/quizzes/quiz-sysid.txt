MA	Which of the items below are part of SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION?	Controller design	incorrect	Experimental planning	correct	Selection of model structure	correct	choice of sensor	incorrect	Criteria	correct	Parameter estimation	correct	Model validation	correct	PID tuning	incorrect
SR	In your own words, what are the advantages of system identification compared to mathematical model building?	Mathematical model building can be difficult and very time-consuming. System identification can give good models of the system based only on experients with the system and measurements of input-output data.
SR	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>In the video by Prof Ljung, he talks about the principle of system identification, and shows the figure below. In your own words, what is his point? <p><img src="http://alfkjartan.github.io/images/ljung-system-model.png" alt="system-model"></p>	The point he is making is that we send the same signal into the real system and into the model, and then adjust the model parameters so that the error between the output of the system and the output of the model is small. 
SR	In system identification, what is meant by a "Grey box model"?	It is a model, where we know the structure, and maybe some of the parameters, but some parameters are unknown and have to be estimated based on input/output data.
SR	What is meant by "over-fitting"?	That the model is too flexible. In addition to describing the model dynamics it also describes the particular noise in the identification data.

The minimum of the function is achieved at the point \(\theta^*\).

SR	In your own words, What is meant by "over-fitting"?	That the model is too flexible. In addition to describing the model dynamics it also describes the particular noise in the identification data.
SR	In your own words, what is validation data, and why is it important to test the identified model on this data?	Validation data are input-output data NOT used in identifying the model. A good model should also give good fit when applied to the validation data.
