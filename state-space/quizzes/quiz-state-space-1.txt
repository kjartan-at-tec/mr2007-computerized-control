But state space models are very easy to extend to MIMO systems (Multiple input Multiple Output). In your own words, why is it easy to extend a state space models to several inputs and outputs?	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>The state space model is \[ x(k+1) = \Phi x(k) + \Gamma u(k) \] \[ y(k) = Cx(k) + Du(k).\] To get a MIMO system we simply let \(u\) and \(y\) be vectors. Then \(\Gamma\) and \(C\) will be matrices.
MC	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>Consider the state space model \[ x(k+1) = \Phi x(k) + \Gamma u(k) \] \[ y(k) = Cx(k) + Du(k).\]Let \(x(0) = x_0\) (initial state) and \(u(k) = 0\) (no forcing input). What is \(x(4)\)?	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script> \(\Phi^3 x_0\)	incorrect	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script> \(\Phi^4 x_0\)	correct	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script> \(4\Phi x_0\)	incorrect
SR	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>Consider the stable autonomous (without input) discrete state space system \[ x(k+1) = \Phi x(k).\] If at time \(k=0\) the state is \(x(0) = v\), where \(v\) is an eigen vector of \(\Phi\), what can we say about the solution \(x(k)\) as time proceeds?	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>The solution \(x(k)\) will go towards the origin along the direction of the eigenvector \(v\), since \(x(1) = \Phi x(0) = \Phi v = \lambda v\), so \(x(k) = \lambda^k v\).  
SR	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>What is the requirement on the matrix \(\Phi\) in \(x(k+1) = \Phi x(k) + \Gamma u(k)\) for the state space system to be asymptotically stable?	The eigenvalues must be inside the unit circle.
