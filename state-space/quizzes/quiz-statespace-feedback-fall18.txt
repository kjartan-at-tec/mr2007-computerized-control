But state space models are very easy to extend to MIMO systems (Multiple input Multiple Output). In your own words, why is it easy to extend a state space models to several inputs and outputs?	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>The state space model is \[ x(k+1) = \Phi x(k) + \Gamma u(k) \] \[ y(k) = Cx(k) + Du(k).\] To get a MIMO system we simply let \(u\) and \(y\) be vectors. Then \(\Gamma\) and \(C\) will be matrices.

SR	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>Consider the stable autonomous (without input) discrete state space system \[ x(k+1) = \Phi x(k).\] If at time \(k=0\) the state is \(x(0) = v\), where \(v\) is an eigen vector of \(\Phi\), what can we say about the solution \(x(k)\) as time proceeds?	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>The solution \(x(k)\) will go towards the origin along the direction of the eigenvector \(v\), since \(x(1) = \Phi x(0) = \Phi v = \lambda v\), so \(x(k) = \lambda^k v\).  
SR	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>What is the requirement on the matrix \(\Phi\) in \(x(k+1) = \Phi x(k) + \Gamma u(k)\) for the state space system to be asymptotically stable?	The eigenvalues must be inside the unit circle.

MC	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>In chapter  4.3 of Åström & Wittenmark it is described how a general state-space system \[ x(k+1) = \Phi x(k) + \Gamma u(k) \] \[y(k) = Cx(k) + Du(k)\] can be transformed into the reachable canonical form by a certain transformation of the state vector.

SR	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>Assume that the specifications on our closed-loop system are given as the set of closed-loop poles \(\{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n\}\). How do we use the specifications to determine the controller parameters \(L=\begin{bmatrix}l_1 & l_2 & \cdots & l_n\end{bmatrix}\)?	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>The main idea is to derive the characteristic equation for the closed loop system with system matrix \(\Phi - \Gamma L\) and compare to the desired characteristic equation found by expanding the expression \((z-p_1)(z-p_2) \cdots (z-p_n)\). Equate the coefficients to find the controller parameters. There are two ways to do this. The textbook explains that the system can be transformed to controllable canonical form, from which it is easy to find the characteristic equation. Another method is to write out \(\det \left( zI - (\Phi - \Gamma L) \right)\).
MC	Is it always possible to place the closed-loop poles at the desired positions using state feedback?	No	correct	Yes	incorrect
SR	Motivate your answer to the above question!	No, it only possible to freely place the closed-loop poles if the system is reachable/controllable. Otherwise, the possible closed-loop poles are restricted to lie in a subspace of the z-plane.
