Why is this so?	Because we seldom have access to the full state vector. Typically, we can only measure the output signal of the plant.	correct	Because the plant may be unstable otherwise	incorrect	Because Dr Abbott said so	incorrect	To get better closed-loop performance	incorrect
SR	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>In the video by Dr Abbott, he first suggests that one can simulate the plant in order to obtain an estimate of the state vector \(\hat{x}(k)\), as in the image below <p><img src="http://alfkjartan.github.io/images/observer-open-loop.png" alt="observer-open-loop"></p> What is the problem with this approach?	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>There is no correction to the estimate \(\hat{x}(k)\) based on a comparison of the measured output \(y(k)\) and the observer output \(\hat{y}(k)\). So even if the model in the observer is perfect, the estimation will have an error due to the initial state that will go to zero only as fast as the eigenvalues of \(\Phi\). And if the system is unstable, i.e. the eigenvalues of \(\Phi\) are outside the unit circle, then the estimate error \(\tilde{x}(k) = x(k) - \hat{x}(k)\) will grow to infinity. 
MC	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>The state observer is \[\hat{x}(k+1) = \left( \Phi - KC\right) \hat{x}(k) + \Gamma u(k) + Ky(k) \] with poles given by the eigenvalues of \( \Phi - KC \). How should we choose these poles?	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>Slower than the poles of the closed-loop system \(\Phi - \Gamma L\). 	incorrect	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>Equal to the poles of the closed loop system \(\Phi - \Gamma L\)	incorrect	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>Faster than the poles of the closed loop system \(\Phi - \Gamma L\)	correct
MC	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>A fast convergence of the observer corresponds to the eigenvalues of  \( \Phi -KC\) being close to the origin in the \(z\)-plane, and is typically associated with a large observer gain \(K\). What is the drawback of choosing a too fast observer (too large observer gain \(K\)?	The closed-loop system could become unstable	incorrect	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>The closed-loop system becomes sensitive to measurement errors in \(y(k)\)	correct	The closed-loop system will be slow to react to disturbances	incorrect
