The system is described by the difference equation \(y_{k+1} - ay_k = bu_k\) and has impulse response given by \[h(k) = \begin{cases} ba^{k-1} & k \ge 1\\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\]  Which of the below following expressions corresponds to the pulse response of the system of \(b=2\) and \(a = 0.5\)?	<img src="http://alfkjartan.github.io/images/discrete-sys-response-2.png" alt="time response 1">	incorrect	<img src="http://alfkjartan.github.io/images/discrete-sys-response-1.png" alt="time response 2">	correct	<img src="http://alfkjartan.github.io/images/discrete-sys-response-4.png" alt="time response 3">	incorrect	<img src="http://alfkjartan.github.io/images/discrete-sys-response-3.png" alt="time response 4">	incorrect	
SR	Motivate your answer to the above problem!	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>The expression for the impulse response for \(k \ge 1\) is the sequence \(h(k) = 2\cdot (0.5)^{k-1}\). This is an monotonic exponentially decaying sequence starting with \(h(1) = 2\), \(h(2) = 1\). Clearly, this corresponds to alternative 2. 
MC	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>From Rich Radke's video on z-transform you may recall that the Laplace transform reduces to the Fourier transform when it is evaluated for \(s=i\omega\). In other words when the Laplace transform is evaluated for values on the imaginary axis of the \(s\)-plane. Similarly, if the Z-transform is evaluated for certain values in the \(z\)-plane it reduces to the discrete-time Fourier transform. Which values are Radke refering to?	The real axis of the z-plane	incorrect	The imaginary axis of the z-plane	incorrect	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>The unit circle \(z=\mathrm{e}^{i\Omega}\)	correct
SR	In your own words, what is the purpose of a zero-order-hold block, what kind of input does it accept and how are the output and input of the zero-order-hold block related?				  The block corresponds to the DA-converter of the computer. It takes a sequence of numbers as input, and generates a continuous-time output signal which has an amplitude which is equal to the latest number in the sequence. It transforms a discrete-time signal into a stair-case function, with jumps at the time instants of the input sequence.

The system is sampled using zero-order-hold to obtain a discrete-time pulse-transfer function \(H(z)\). Where in the z-plane are the poles of \(H(z)\)?

SR	There is a Final Value Theorem defined for discrete-time systems, similar to the case for continuous-time systems. In your own words, what is the use of the Final value Theorem?	It allows us to calculate the value of a signal in our system as time goes to infinity without solving for the difference equation.
