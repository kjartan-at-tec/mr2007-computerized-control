SR	If the signal from the plant is analog (e.g. from a sensor), and the input signal to the plant  (controlling an actuator) is also analog, what are the steps to get the signals into the computer?
SR	In the jupyter notebook Discrete-time-systems-intro.ipynb, why  is the error in the discrete approximation larger in the beginning than at the end of the step-response?	The discrete system approximates the derivatives in the continuos ODE. In the beginning of the response, the changes in the derivatives (both input- and output signal) between the sampling instants are largest.    
SR	In your own words, why are performance specifications important when designing a controller?	Without the specifications, we have no way of evaluating our design.
MA	Which of the following are common control performance specifications?	Rise time	correct	Maximum overshoot	correct	Return on investement	incorrect	Settling time	correct	Bandwidth	correct	Signal-to-noise ratio	incorrect	Steady-state error	correct	Phase margin	correct
SR	Choose one of the performance specifications above and give its definition.
