SR	If the signal from the plant is analog (e.g. from a sensor), and the input signal to the plant  (controlling an actuator) is also analog, what are the steps to get the signals into the computer?	To convert a continuous-time signal from a sensor into a discrete-time signal in the computer, it must be sampled and then digitized by converting the signal value at each samping instant into a binary representation. To convert the discrete signal in the computer to an analog output signal, it is common to use zero-order-hold, meaning that the analog output signal is constant equal to the previous signal value between sampling instants.   ﻿﻿﻿﻿

SR	If the signal from the plant is analog (e.g. from a sensor), and the input signal to the plant  (controlling an actuator) is also analog, what are the steps to get the signals in and out of the computer?	To convert a continuous-time signal from a sensor into a discrete-time signal in the computer, it must be sampled and then digitized by converting the signal value at each samping instant into a binary representation. To convert the discrete signal in the computer to an analog output signal, it is common to use zero-order-hold, meaning that the analog output signal is constant equal to the previous signal value between sampling instants.
SR	Example 1.2 in Astrom and Wittenmark demonstrates the difference between the two main approaches to obtain a discrete controller. The first way is to do a design in continuous-time and then discretized the controller. This approach gave a closed-loop system with time-response given in the figure below for two different choices of sampling interval.<p><img src="http://alfkjartan.github.io/images/fig1-8.png" alt="time response 1"></p>The other approach is to design a controller based on a discrete-time model of the plant. This approach gave a closed-loop system with the response below.<p><img src="http://alfkjartan.github.io/images/fig1-9.png" alt="time response 2"></p>Discribe in 4-8 sentences the interesting differences between the continuous-time system reponses and the alternative discrete-time system responses.	<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>In the first figure we can note that with the longer sampling interval leads to an unstable system. With shorter sampling interval the system is stable, and quite close to the response of the continuous-time response. As the sampling interval goes to zero, the discrete-time response will approach the response of the continuous-time system. In the second figure showing the response of a so-called deadbeat controller, we note that the output goes much quicker to the final desired value than the continuous-time response. It is exactly equal to the desired output after 2 sampling periods, or at \(t=\frac{2.8}{\omega_0}\). This is achieved with an input signal (control signal) that has the same maximum amplitude as the continuous-time controller.
